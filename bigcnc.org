** TODO diagram of intra unit 3 wiring (limit switches etc)              :Alon:
*** based off CNC Inter Units Cabling
*** Use LibreOffice Draw?
*** Each assembly is designated 3A1, 3A2 etc
*** We have existing wires with labels, so their J subassemblies will be parts of the relevant As
*** for instance: 3J8 is part of 3A1 (made up example)

**** TODO choose wire
**** TODO choose connector
**** TODO do the wiring
*** TODO control spindle programmatically (nice to have)
** TODO linear rails [0/1]
*** TODO clean and grease the linear rails
** TODO water cooling for the motor [0/1]
** TODO Water cooling for bit
** TODO hole for 2J1 (USB)
*** measured at 21-22mm diameter (TODO measure precisely with calipers)
*** search for USB connector that fits this hole
** TODO continuity check all the cables
** TODO [0/3] Z-axis Brake:
*** TODO ask Guy if he ordered the cable and plug                      :Alon:
    SCHEDULED: <2018-05-07 Mon>
*** TODO find part number for brake plug (Z-axis): W6P3
*** TODO choose a cable for the brake plug: connecting W6P3 to W6P1 (two conductor, flexible, 670 cm)
** TODO [0/2] Spindle
*** TODO find Spindle cable                                            :Alon:
should be in the previous incarnation of cables. Matches Spindle motor. If it's too hard, cut out the connector only. Dead or alive.
** TODO find & photograph w/ reference frame Unit 2 Panel (steel, cut, approx 20x40 cm^2). (picture in google docs) :Alon:
** TODO measure w/ calibre / ruler diameter of spindle hole in unit 2 panel                                         :Alon:
** TODO [0/2] Limit switches
*** TODO verify they are connected (Jeremy's work) :Alon:
    SCHEDULED: <2018-05-09 Wed>
*** TODO acquire cable                                                  :Guy:
** TODO document dimensions of Unit 2 (control box) <2018-05-23 Wed>    :Guy:Alon:
** TODO disassamble and bring panel of control box <2018-05-23 Wed>     :Guy:Alon:

Misc Data
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

* Idan's email: idan.kp@gmail.com
** TODO ask Idan how things are going (gently) with the limit switch mechanics on Tuesday :Alon:

* Documentation
Computerized numerical control machine for TAMI.

* Definitions
** unit 1: the PC
** unit 2: Control box 
** unit 3: the CNC machine itself
** Cables are marked with W
** Plug's ends are marked with a P
** cable tracks: black plastic conduits that look like the tracks of a tank, rotating with the cables when the CNC moves

* Basic outline of cabling
PC <-USB-> Control Box
Control Box gets 220V
Control Box to CNC:
1. Bulk of cables: 2 cables per motor: encoder & power (total 6)
 1.1 Z axis is special, includes braking cable
2. Limit switches cable
3. Spindle cable

Meeting Notes
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

* First meeting of the new era of the CNC
** <2017-10-18 Wed>
** Learned about Reference Designation
** Took down task notes
** Alon picked the secretery position
** Looked at a problem on the X axis, the connection between the ball screw and it's shaft coupler is marginal because the screw was cut too short.

* [2017-10-25 Wed] meeting
** Guy brought limit switches instead of the existing ones.
** TODO notify Idan about limit switches                                 :me:
** Guy brought cable samples
** will use google sheets, and stop using the excels.


* [2018-06-05]
** DONE Review 2-3 cabeling. Z-break, limit
** NEXT review cabeling in unit 2 (control box)

* [2018-06-22]
** research about PC interface board
*** parallel port is out: obsolete.
*** mach3 is being phased out but still has lots of community. 
*** conclusion: find an interface board that supports mach4, and ideally also mach3 (usually true anyway)
*** this disqualifies both boards we have on-hand
*** TODO look for the best interface board: not too expensive (<200$), good reviews, works without complications. step/dir output (most are)
*** some candidates: ESS (Ethernet Smooth Stepper), various UCxxx, PoKeys57CNC
*** check electrical properties of the I/O of the samsung motor drivers. It may be a chore to interface them to the PC interface board, if the board uses different voltage and current

* [2018-07-22]
** Ethernet Smooth Stepper (ESS) is chosen as interface board. a decent deal on ESS + Mach4 license + adapter board is found in https://cnc4pc.com/ethernet-smooth-stepper-board.html
** problem 1: limit switch signals should reach both ESS and drives, but drives expect 24V and ESS expects 5V.
** problem 2: ESS adapter board (model C25) has a high input current (~15mA!) becasue of the LEDs. This complicates possible circuits that handle the 24V<-->5V interface.
*** solution 1: build a more complicated interface circuit that overcomes this. 
*** solution 2: don't use the C25 adapter board. find a better adapter board and build an interface circuit to it (24V<-->5V)
*** solution 3: don't use the C25 adapter board. build an adapter board ourselves that fits our requirements exactly [preferred by Guy]. May save on wiring effort.
